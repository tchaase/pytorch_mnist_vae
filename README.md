# pytorch_mnist_VAE


This repository was made to play around with the [MNIST-database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and variational autoencoders to explore how they work. 

Here are some of the ressources I used:

* [A blog on VAE in particular for this data-set](https://debuggercafe.com/convolutional-variational-autoencoder-in-pytorch-on-mnist-dataset/). From this blog I took the basic code and then tried to understand whats going on from there.
